Just a simple battleships game.
In order to run it just go into project folder location and than into "\Battleships\bin\Release\net6.0" and run Battleships.exe file.

# How to play
Legend:
- light blue [ ~ ] - place that haven't been discovered yet
- yellow [ B ] - you've hit battleship but not sunk it yet
- yellow [ D ] - you've hit destroyer but not sunk it yet
- red [ X ] - you've sunk enemy ship there
- grey [ M ] - you missed
- Feedback - visual information on board as well as text information in the console.

Computer randomly positions 3 ships on the board
- 2 Destroyers of size 4
- 1 Battleship of size 5

You need to provide coordinates where you want to take shot (for example "A1 or E10"). Once you do you will get feedback if you missed or hit one of the ships. Once you sunk one of the ships you will get the feedback as well.

When you sink all 3 ships the game ends

Don't forget to have fun :)
